# Hangman
## Funtionality 
The game is based on the classic children's game Hangman. The goal is to guess a hidden word. Individual letters are always suggested and depending on whether the letter appears in the word, it is revealed or a life is deducted. The available lives are symbolized by a drawn gallows and a stick figure hanging on it. As soon as the drawing is complete, the game is lost.
